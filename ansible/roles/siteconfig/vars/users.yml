# nucleator cage configure will install users specified in nucleator_ssh_users on the bastion host in each cage.
# To remove a user, leave the user in nucleator_ssh_users and specify "state: absent"
#
# While the password is not used for login authentication, it is set on the bastion because certain 3p apps may
# rely on a system-managed user password being available.
