SSL Certificate File for build.example.yourdomain.com

You will need to replace this file's contents with a valid SSL Certificate.
Stacksets that require SSL Certificates will look for them in this directory.
The convention for filenames for SSL Certificates is:

    {customer}-{cage}.crt

You can procure an SSL Certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) of your
choice, in which case the Certificate will be signed by your chosen CA.

Alternatively, you can act as your own Certificate Authority and, and create
a Self-Signed Certificate.

If you wish to create a self-signed certificate, you can do so using the
make-self-signed-crt script.  The script can be found in the same directory
as this file.  It's usage is:

    make-self-signed-crt <customer> <cage> <customer-domain>

For example:

    make-self-signed-crt example build example.yourdomain.com

This will generate a wildcard certificate for *.build.example.yourdomain.com
in the file example-build.crt.

The generated server key and certificate signing request will also be available
in the files example-build.key and example-build.csr.
